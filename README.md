# data-science-projects
A growing collection of end-to-end data science projects covering data analysis, machine learning, model tuning, class imbalance handling, and explainability. Built as part of my journey as a first-year student preparing for data science internships through practical, real-world problem solving.

📊 Data Science Portfolio
👋 About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of end-to-end data science projects built as part of my journey toward becoming a Data Scientist.
As a first-year student, my goal is to develop strong foundations in:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Machine learning modeling
Hyperparameter tunin
Handling class imbalance
Model evaluation
Explainability (SHAP, feature importance)
Business-oriented insights
Each project follows a structured, reproducible pipeline from raw data to final insights.

🎯 Objective
The purpose of this repository is to:
Apply theoretical concepts to real-world datasets
Build internship-ready machine learning pipelines
Improve both analytical thinking and technical implementation
Document continuous learning and growth
This portfolio reflects my progress in applied data science and machine learning.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Data Visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn)
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Model Evaluation (ROC-AUC, F1, Confusion Matrix)
SMOTE for class imbalance
Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
SHAP explainability

📂 Projects Included
1️⃣ Telco Customer Churn Prediction
End-to-end classification project predicting customer churn using XGBoost and Random Forest, including SMOTE balancing and SHAP explainability.
(More projects will be added as I continue learning.)

🚀 Future Additions
Planned expansions include:
Regression projects
Time series forecasting
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Deep learning models
Model deployment projects
Business cost-based evaluation

📈 Learning Philosophy
I focus on:
Writing clean, structured code
Understanding why models make predictions
Connecting technical results to business impact
Continuously improving through iteration
